# Employee-App Instructions:

You can just run the "docker-compose up" which should raise 4 containers:

1 - postgres
2 - nginx
3 - vue 3 client
4 - nodejs server

and then just go to "localhost:80".

another way is to run the client and server locally using the following commands:
"/client/npm run dev"
"/server/npm run dev"
